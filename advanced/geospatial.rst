Geospatial searches
===================

Xapian's geospatial support is currently still a work in progress, and
until it is generally available this documentation will either be
empty or may be out of date.

.. todo:: Write about how to index geolocation information, and how to use the
          geo posting sources and keymaker to sort by distance, bias results by
          distance, and limit results by distance.  Discuss storing geo
          bounding boxes terms for accelerating distance limited searches.
