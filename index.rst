Contributing
------------

The source for this documentation is being kept on
http://github.com/jaylett/xapian-docsprint.  The best way to contribute is
to add issues, comments and pull requests there.

Assuming you're on Debian or Ubuntu or another Debian-derived distro, you'll
need to install either the `python-sphinx` or `python3-sphinx` package in
order to be able to generate this documentation from a git checkout.  Once
you've done that, you can generate HTML output with `make html`.

We're monitoring IRC during the sprint sessions (and in general) so you can
also contact us on channel #xapian on irc.freenode.net (webchat link:
http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23xapian).
