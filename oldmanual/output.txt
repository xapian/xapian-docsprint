Chapter 2: Databases
--------------------

       Pretty much all Xapian operations revolve around a Xapian
       _database_. Before performing a search, details of the documents
       being searched need to be put into the database - the search process
       then refers to the database to determine the best matches for a
       given query. The process of putting documents into the database is
       usually referred to as indexing.

   2.1 Creating and opening databases

       Databases can be opened for reading only, or for reading
       and writing. A database reader is represented by a
       `Xapian::Database' object, and a database writer is
       represented by a `Xapian::WritableDatabase' object. Note that
       `Xapian::WritableDatabase' is a subclass of `Xapian::Database', so
       it's possible to do all operations that it's possible to do on a
       `Xapian::Database' on a `Xapian::WritableDatabase'. For example, a
       search can be performed on a `Xapian::WritableDatabase'.

       The easiest way to create a new database is simply to call the
       `Xapian::WritableDatabase' constructor:

         Xapian::WritableDatabase db("myfirstdb", Xapian::DB_CREATE);

       This will create a new database, using the default database format,
       at the path `myfirstdb' (relative to the current working directory).
       The DB_CREATE flag tells the constructor to create a new database:
       an exception will be raised if a database (or anything else) already
       exists at the specified path. Other available flags are:

        -  DB_CREATE_OR_OPEN: like DB_CREATE, but will simply open the
           database at the specified path if it already exists.

        -  DB_CREATE_OR_OVERWRITE: like DB_CREATE, but will overwrite the
           database at the specified path if it already exists.

        -  DB_OPEN: the database will be opened if it already exists, but
           if it doesn't exist an exception will be raised.

       To open a database for reading, use the `Xapian::Database'
       constructor:

         Xapian::Database db_readonly("myfirstdb");

       This will open the database for reading only, and raise an exception
       if no database exists at the specified path.

       There are various different formats of database; if you want a
       format other than the default format for some reason, there are
       special factory methods available to create such databases - see
       section 2.9 for details. The Xapian::Database constructor will
       automatically determine the format of the database at the path
       supplied and open it (assuming the format is recognised). Similarly,
       the Xapian::WritableDatabase constructors, when supplied with an
       existing database, and appropriate flags (ie, `Xapian::DB_OPEN' or
       `Xapian::DB_CREATE_OR_OPEN') will also automatically determine the
       format and open it.

       If you just want to get on with adding documents to a database, you
       can skip to the next chapter now. There are lots of things to be
       aware of about databases when building a production-ready system
       on top of Xapian, though, so come back and read the rest of this
       chapter later!

 2.1.1 Closing

       A writable database is closed automatically when both the
       `Xapian::WritableDatabase' object is deleted, and when any Xapian
       objects which are derived from the database object are closed. For
       example, if a `Xapian::PostingIterator' has been created from the
       database, the database will not be closed until that iterator is
       deleted as well as the database object. (See section 8.1 for more
       details on `Xapian::PostingIterator').

       This is very convenient in many situations - it means that it is
       not necessary to keep track of whether a database object has been
       deleted yet when using iterators or other objects derived from it.
       However, it can result in the database remaining open longer than
       expected, causing problems if you try and open the database for
       writing again before the database has been closed.

       For this reason, databases support an explicit `close()' method.
       This can be called to close a database immediately, without waiting
       for all references to the database to be deleted. If an attempt is
       made to access the database after closing, it will usually result in
       a `Xapian::DatabaseError' exception being raised.

   2.4 Remote databases

       - running the server

       - note about using a stub database to serve multiple databases
       together

       - opening

   2.6 Flipping databases

       It is often useful to update a database by building a new database
       containing an updated version of the data, and flipping from the
       old version to the new version, so that newly opened readers start
       picking up the new version of the database. This can be done to
       great effect, but there are several things to be aware of if you are
       performing searches in parallel with this change.

       Obviously, deleting the old database and copying or moving a new
       database into place would leave a window of time in which any
       readers trying to open the database would find files missing,
       producing Xapian::DatabaseOpeningError errors. If you simply
       copy or replace the individual files, you may get even more
       subtle errors; Xapian will usually notice the discrepancy if some
       files from an old version of the database and some from a new
       version are present, but may not always do so, and may well raise
       Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError if it becomes confused.

       There are actually very few filesystem operations which can be used
       to allow an "atomic" change to be made to a database. Fortunately,
       there is one such operation: moving a file to a new path, replacing
       any copies of the database at that path, is an atomic operation on
       almost all systems. [FIXME - check for details of any systems where
       it isn't.] All processes will either see the filesystem as it was
       before the move/replace, or as it was afterwards; there'll never be
       a partial modification visible.

       The recommended approach for flipping database versions is to use
       a stub database to refer to the current version of the database.
       One approach is be to append a timestamp to the end of each newly
       created database, and then to create a stub database file pointing
       to the latest database. Once the newly created database is in place
       and ready to be used, the newly created stub database file can be
       moved to replace the old stub database file, taking advantage of the
       atomic nature of this operation to ensure that a reader would never
       see a partially flipped database.

       On POSIX filesystems, the contents of an open file can be accessed
       even if the original file on disk has been unlinked. An open Xapian
       database maintains an open filehandle to all the files holding the
       database contents. This allows the old version of the database to be
       unlinked immediately after the stub database file has been updated,
       without fear that an open reader will be affected by this deletion.

       On non POSIX filesystems (specifically, on Windows), an error will
       be raised by a reader if the files it was using are deleted before
       it completes. On such systems, you should either wait for all
       readers using the old version to close, or be prepared to catch
       errors due to the deletion.

       Don't be tempted to use a symlink instead of a stub database to
       switch between database versions. Xapian doesn't resolve all
       symlinks on the path to a database before opening it, so if the
       symlink is changed while the database is being opened, a mixture of
       old and new files may be opened.

   2.7 Reopening

       Database readers access a static version of the database, and do not
       reflect updates to the database made since they were opened. The
       version of the database accessed by the reader can be updated to the
       latest version by calling the `Xapian::Database::reopen()' method.
       This is faster than closing the database and opening a fresh reader
       - especially in the case when no changes have been made.

       FIXME - talk about strategies to avoid the DatabaseModifiedError -
       eg, calling reopen before performing each search, putting searches
       into a loop which repeats if DatabaseModifiedError occurs, and
       ensuring that commits() don't happen with a shorter gap than the
       time searches take.

       When a `Xapian::DatabaseModifiedError' is received the reader can be
       updated to the latest version

       FIXME - add a warning about stubs not being re-read, and a link to
       the relevant ticket.

   2.9 Database backend formats

       Xapian databases store data in custom formats which allow searches
       to be performed extremely quickly. This typically involves storing a
       mapping from all the words in the documents to the list of documents
       those words occurred in, together with various statistics about
       these occurrences. It may also involve storing the full text of the
       documents, so that result text can be displayed.

       A great deal of compression is used to store this information,
       but the database sizes are still often comparable to the size
       of the input data, since they hold both the original data, and
       the "inverted" data. Database sizes depend heavily on the way in
       which documents are processed, and what information is stored -
       this should be matched to the types of searches which need to be
       supported on the data, to avoid storing unwanted information. See
       chapter 7 for details of this.

       Xapian databases are usually held in the filesystem, as a set of
       files in a database directory, but may also be held in memory, or on
       a remote machine.

       Xapian supports several different database `backends`. For any
       particular release of Xapian, one of these backends will be the
       default backend, and will be used when a database is created if
       you don't choose a particular backend format. Some backends are
       supported for backwards compatibility, some provide support for
       distributed searching, or keeping a database in memory, and others
       may be experimental.

       At the time of writing, the current backends are available in
       supported versions of Xapian. Note that Xapian may be compiled
       without support for some of these databases.

 2.9.1 The Flint backend

       In the 1.0.x release series, Flint was the default backend. It is
       still supported for backwards compatibility in the 1.2.x release
       series. Support is likely to be dropped at the end of the 1.2.x
       release series.

       To open a Flint database explicitly, use the Flint::open() method.

 2.9.2 The Chert backend

       The Chert backend is the default backend in the 1.2.x release
       series. It was based on the Flint database format, but portions
       of it have been modified heavily to improve performance. Database
       sizes with flint are considerably smaller, and various additional
       statistics are stored which allow searches to be performed faster.
       Some features, such as range searches, can be performed considerably
       more efficiently with Chert than with Flint, due to the format
       changes.

 2.9.3 The Brass backend

       The Brass backend is currently in development - it is expected to
       stabilise for the 1.4.x release series. Before that point, you
       should probably only use the Brass backend if you are working on
       development or testing of it. The format of Brass databases may be
       changed with little or no warning until it has stabilised.

 2.9.4 The InMemory backend

       As suggested by its name, the InMemory backend holds its databases
       in memory, rather than on disk. This makes it a reasonable candidate
       for use when you have a small number of documents, and want to build
       a temporary database from them to perform a few searches.

       Unfortunately, the current implementation is not very efficient -
       the backend was implemented mainly for testing. This is actually the
       oldest backend in Xapian! The backend has fairly poor performance,
       and doesn't have support for some recently added features. It also
       doesn't support transations at all.

       If there is sufficient demand, this backend is likely to be re-
       implemented at some point, possibly using shared memory to allow
       multiple processes to access the database, and using the data format
       of one of the on-disk databases. Work has not begun on this at the
       time of writing: as ever, contact the Xapian developers if you would
       like to help!

Chapter 3: Documents
--------------------

   3.3 Building documents.

   3.4 Adding documents.

   3.7 Lazy loading.

       In order to avoid unnecessary work, the contents of a
       `Xapian::Document' object derived from a database are not normally
       loaded from the database immediately when the document is obtained.
       Instead, various parts of the document are loaded on demand. This
       can give a nice efficiency boost in situations where only a part of
       the document is loaded. For example, in the following code, only the
       `data' part of the document will be loaded; the termlist and values
       will not be accessed:

         Xapian::Database db("testdb");
         Xapian::Document doc = db.get_document(1);
         std::cout << doc.get_data() <<std::endl;

       This is normally entirely transparent to the user, but can have a
       visible effect in some very specific circumstances. If the database
       the document is read from is a `Xapian::WritableDatabase', two
       copies of the document are obtained from it, one copy is modified
       and written back to the database, and then the contents of the
       second copy are accessed, the second copy will contain the data that
       the second copy was set to.

       This might be clearer with a bit of example code:

         Xapian::WritableDatabase db("db", Xapian::DB_CREATE_OR_OPEN);
         Xapian::Document doc1 = db.get_document(1);
         Xapian::Document doc2 = db.get_document(1);
         doc1.set_data("hello");
         db.replace_document(1, doc1);
         std::cout << doc2.get_data() <<std::endl;
         // Output is "hello"

       If you want to force all the contents of a document to be read
       immediately, one easy way is to call the document's `serialise()'
       method. This leads us nicely on to the next section!
